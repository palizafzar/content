    <h2><strong>What is a UPS?</strong></h2>
    <p class="mar-btm-30">An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is an electrical apparatus that provides emergency power to a load when the input power source or mains power fails. A UPS differs from an auxiliary or emergency power system or standby generator in that it will provide near-instantaneous protection from input power interruptions, by supplying energy stored in batteries, super capacitors, or flywheels.</p>

    <h2><strong>The main components of a UPS are:</strong></h2>
    <dl class="mar-left-20">
        <dt>Rectifier:</dt>
        <dd class="mar-btm-30">This part of the UPS converts the incoming alternating current (AC) supply to direct current (DC) and can provide charging current for the battery and also the supply requirements for the inverter.</dd>

        <dt>Charger:</dt>
        <dd class="mar-btm-30">In a number of UPS systems, separate battery charger is used due to the nature of their design. </dd>

        <dt>Battery:</dt>
        <dd class="mar-btm-30">This is the power storage section and is kept charged either by the rectifier or a separate charger. Its storage capacity is generally displayed as AH (ampere hour), which is the number of amperes of current that the battery can supply for an hour.</dd>

        <dt>Inverter:</dt>
        <dd class="mar-btm-30">This section of the Uninterruptible power supply provides an AC output to the load which is in phase with the input mains supply. Due to the number of conversions (AC to DC to AC) and the filtering involved it can be termed as a ‘clean supply’.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h2 class="mar-btm-20"><strong>UPS Types:</strong></h2>
    <dl class="mar-left-20">
        <dt>Offline/standby UPS:</dt>
        <dd class="mar-btm-30">The offline/standby UPS offers only the most basic features, providing surge protection and battery backup. The protected equipment is normally connected directly to incoming utility power. When the incoming voltage falls below or rises above a predetermined level the SPS(Standby Power Supply) turns on its internal DC-AC inverter circuitry, which is powered from an internal storage battery. The SPS then mechanically switches the connected equipment on to its DC-AC inverter output. The switchover time can be as long as 25 milliseconds depending on the amount of time it takes the standby UPS to detect the lost utility voltage. The UPS will be designed to power certain equipment, such as a personal computer, without any objectionable dip or brownout to that device.</dd>

        <dt>Online/double-conversion UPS:</dt>
        <dd class="mar-btm-30">The online UPS is ideal for environments where electrical isolation is necessary or for equipment that is very sensitive to power fluctuations. The initial cost of the online UPS may be higher, but its total cost of ownership is generally lower due to longer battery life. The online UPS may be necessary when the power environment is "noisy", when utility power sags, outages and other anomalies are frequent, when protection of sensitive IT equipment loads is required, or when operation from an extended-run backup generator is necessary.</dd>

        <dt>Line-interactive UPS:</dt>
        <dd class="mar-btm-30">The line-interactive UPS is similar in operation to a standby UPS, but with the addition of a multi-tap variable-voltage autotransformer. This is a special type of transformer that can add or subtract powered coils of wire, thereby increasing or decreasing the magnetic field and the output voltage of the transformer. This is also known as a Buck-boost transformer. This type of UPS is able to tolerate continuous under voltage brownouts and overvoltage surges without consuming the limited reserve battery power. It instead compensates by automatically selecting different power taps on the autotransformer.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h2><strong>What is UPS Bypass mode?</strong></h2>
    <p class="mar-btm-30">UPS Bypass mode is when you switch the circuit from going through the UPS to going around or bypassing it. A manual bypass switch is used to remove the UPS system from the circuit for servicing or maintenance or if it is no longer working correctly. An automatic transfer switch functions in the same way as a manual, but will also switch the UPSs load to mains electric automatically if the UPS experiences an internal failure.</p>

    <h2><strong>UPS Battery of time and attendance system:</strong></h2>
    <p class="mar-btm-30">When the time and attendance device is connected to power, the internal UPS battery starts charging. When main power is cut off, at the same time, the relay automatically allows the internal battery to be used without interruption to maintain the <a href="https://www.palizafzar.com/en/products/tx/" title="time and attendance device" target="_blank"><strong>time and attendance device</strong></a>. The charge time duration of an UPS battery lasts from 6 to 8 hours depending on availability of time and attendance device, and between 8 and 20 hours providing use of time attendance device until it turn off.</p>

    <h2><strong>The UPS batteries are used in time and attendance devices:</strong></h2>
    <ul class="mar-btm-30">
        <li>Nickel–cadmium battery 7.4 volt for PF and Timax time and attendance devices version: 2&3</li>
        <li>Lithium batteries 7.4 volt for Timax time and attendance devices version: 4&5</li>
        <li>Batteries 11.2 volt for Virdi time and attendance devices</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><strong>How long UPS batteries are usable when the power has been cut off?</strong></h2>
    <ul class="mar-btm-30">
        <li>The battery of Taimax fingerprint time and attendance provides 26 hours for standby mode and 8 hours for plentiful using of sensor and device.</li>
        <li>The battery of ZK uFace102 face recognition time and attendance device provides 4 hours for standby mode and 2 hours for plentiful using of sensor and device.</li>
    </ul>
