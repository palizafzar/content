    <p>The face is one of the most common non-verbal channels which man transfers his inner emotional state by face. Face recognition has a great application in various fields such as growth psychology, behavioral science, Human and Computer Interface. In new age, authentication is done using a variety of methods such as fingerprinting and face recognition.</p>

    <p>The first experiences face recognition can be seen in 1960, which referred to the drawing methods. Nobody at that time couldn&rsquo;t imagine that half a century later face recognition software can be used by police, security experts, government and/or even as a password in face time attendance. Now, Microsoft uses face recognition software for authentication in Windows 10 while, researchers in Germany are developing new face recognition technology that can identify people in the dark.</p>

    <p>Using computer algorithms a system for identifying a person by trying to measure certain features of his face, such as the distance between eyes and/or the width of the nose, it deals with the process of face recognition. Face recognition is moving from the two-dimensional system to the 3D, this way helps to better identify the person. Also you can easily convert images from two-dimensional to 3D without losing key information or ID.</p>

        <li>Much cognitive science research in the field of human face processing claim that the process of identifying faces is much more general than the process of recognition other objects. That means face recognition is not detected only by identifying and taking into every single feature. As you know, the human eye blinks at the same time, the key to starting the face recognition process is blinking eyes, as well as detecting the living tissue of the skin instead of face a mask.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>What is important in face recognition devices, On the other hand achieving acceptable accuracy for face recognition and another are two challenges memory and time consuming. Therefore, there is always a need to provide a new approach to identifying persons in the large data set at an acceptable time and memory. Recognition and identifying face is the field of multidisciplinary research that uses basic computer techniques, image processing, and modeling. Neural networks have been widely developed until tracking issues in the extraction feature, identify a pattern, and generally identify similar problems.</p>

    <p>One of the challenges in face recognition that has recently attracted much attention in computer and pattern recognition, Face recognition is based on angles and facial gestures relative to the camera. The main goal in a face recognition system is to retrieve images similar to a face from the databases. Face images retrieved can be used for many applications such as image surveillance, face recognition and search of specific faces from the internet.</p>

        <li class="mar-btm-30">Today, face recognition technology plays an important role in displaying advertisements for audiences. Using face recognition technology in CCTV cameras, depending on the type of contact that a lady or the sir is after recognizing the face of the audience, Ads that fit these types of people can appear in the waiting queue of the hospital or stores.</li>

        <li>Now at Miami airport, facial recognition devices currently being used to save time people, using existing face recognition devices In addition to matching the person&#39;s face with his passport photo, the person&#39;s background will be checked at the US police database simultaneously.</li>
