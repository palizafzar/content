    <h2>Bitcoin Wallet:</h2>
    <div class="mar-left-30">
        <p class="mar-btm-30">To work with Bitcoin, you will need a web or windows software to hold Bitcoins. This software is called a Bitcoin wallet. In the Bitcoin wallet, you will be able to send and receive Bitcoins in your Bitcoin public address. The Bitcoin wallet is available as computer software, mobile application, or web software, and it consists of two parts: public address and private key, just like an email that is containing an email address and password.</p>

        <h2>Bitcoin Public Address:</h2>

        <p class="mar-btm-10">Bitcoin public address is a combination of random numbers and letters. The public address belongs to your Bitcoin wallet that can be the same as your bank account number. You can make it available to other people to receive Bitcoins.</p>

    <h2>Blockchain:</h2>

    <ul class="list-unstyled">
        <li>Blockchain is a public list of all Transactions that have been done and sent. With this list, anyone can know that each transaction belongs to which public address. Blockchain is like an extensive database that each transaction is registered in sequence, and according to this, it can be understood that each Bitcoin wallet how much is inventory.</li>
        <li>The blockchain also leads to anonymous people because only the public address of the recipient of each Bitcoin is registered. (Of course, this unknown is not 100% because when exchanging Bitcoins into conventional currencies such as USD and EUR, most exchanges are required by legal institutions to register individual customer data, and they can identify people&#39;s identity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Mining Bitcoins:</h2>

    <ul class="list-unstyled mar-btm-30">
        <li>The&nbsp;idiom &quot;Mining&quot; refers to the bitcoin extraction process, and the idiom &quot;Miner&quot; refers to the person who executes extraction operations. Mining operations require powerful hardware. Early life Bitcoin, anyone could mine a new block with using computer CPUs. Whatever the number of miners increased, the difficulty of mining new blocks suddenly increased. As far as today, the only way cost-effective mining is using specific hardware.</li>
        <li class="mar-left-20">
            <h5>Proof of work:</h5>
        </li>
        <li class="mar-left-20">This method that idiom is called &quot;Hash,&quot; Your computer&#39;s CPU in the Bitcoin network is involved with sophisticated computing as far as can find the right answer. At the same time, a new block is created in Bitcoin that your transactions are registered on a new block. Miner is now entitled to a reward after the original block found. This reward is the same new Bitcoins that are transferred to a miner Bitcoin wallet (e.g., each miner will receive twelve bitcoins for mining every new block.)</li>
        <li>Note that users aren&#39;t miners, and they only intend to buy and sell Bitcoin, due to a large amount of information, it may not be appropriate to use a mobile wallet or desktop wallet. Therefore, it&#39;s recommended to use a web wallet.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Advantages of Bitcoins:</h2>
    <ul class="list-unstyled mar-btm-30">

        <li>Ability to steal Bitcoins by hackers and not retrieve them</li>
        <li>Create problems in data if there is a breakdown in the computer&#39;s hard disk and hackers attack or wallet damage, resulting in loss of bitcoins</li>
    </ul>
