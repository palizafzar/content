    <h2><strong>Importance of using time attendance software:</strong></h2>

    <p class="mar-btm-30 mar-top-10">For each business are usually considered multiple workgroups and various patterns
        depending on the type of employee&#39;s job in large industries. Obviously, manual collection of employee&#39;s
        information is tough and may take up to several days. Attendance software is an exact tool for managing and
        controlling employee traffic. Using time attendance software can cause to economize costs and prevent loss of
        time in the company.</p>

    <h2><strong>Advantages of tracking time and attendance software:</strong></h2>

    <div class="mar-top-30 mar-left-20">
        <h3>Economize paper and avoid cutting trees:</h3>

        <p class="mar-btm-30 mar-top-10">In recent decades, when a time attendance system was done completely manually,
            each employee&#39;s entrance and exit time was enrolled in timesheets. Collecting and estimating an
            employee&#39;s hour was a very laborious task and sometimes lasted for several days. Also, the monthly use
            of paper caused extra costs for the company. Still, nowadays, using devices and time attendance software
            makes it possible to prevent additional costs such as print mission cards and traffic cards.</p>

        <h3>Real-time processing requests and reports:</h3>

        <p class="mar-btm-30 mar-top-10">Since managers are often busy and required to pursue some business outside of
            their company, using web-based <a href="https://www.palizafzar.com/en/products/web-time-attendance/"
                target="_blank" title="Time Attendance Software"><strong>time attendance software</strong></a> can be
            the best choice. On the other hand, the presence of managers is not necessary for the company. Managers can
            report the latest traffic to employees through a PC system, smartphones, and iPad s.</p>

        <h3>Supporting and accessibility information at any time:</h3>

        <p class="mar-btm-30 mar-top-10">Palizafzar&rsquo;s web-based attendance software is developed with &#39;.
            Net&#39; platform and the &#39;SQL Server&#39; database. By installing the server&#39;s database, you can
            make a backup periodically from the entrance and exit log employees, and whenever you need them, you can
            restore it.</p>

        <h3>Time attendance software is easy to work:</h3>

        <p class="mar-btm-30 mar-top-10">When an employee enrolls their log by a time attendance device, authorized
            users and managers can monitor the employee&rsquo;s report log online. Displaying this information as linear
            might seem boring for users. Palizafzar&rsquo;s time attendance software user interface allows users to
            display the enrolling time as graphical charts or sorted tables so that you can look up monthly report
            employees just in a few seconds.</p>

        <h3>Calculation of working hours without the smallest human error:</h3>

        <p class="mar-btm-30 mar-top-10">In manual systems, the possibility of errors in calculating overtime or hour of
            enrolling is observable abundantly, that it causes dissatisfaction between employees and employers.
            Employees may continue to work with unpleasant and mistrust feelings. Using the time and attendance system,
            the relationship between employee and employer will be delighted and based on trust and honesty.</p>

        <h3>Ability transfers the information to payroll software:</h3>

        <p class="mar-top-10">According to the defined rule, vacations, missions, and holidays will be reduced or
            increased automatically in time attendance software. The raw output files can transfer to payroll software
            in various formats such as &#39;.txt,&#39; &#39;.dat&#39; or excel to pay employees&#39; salaries at
            a&nbsp;specific time at the end of each month.</p>
