    <h2>Voice Recognition or Speech Recognition?</h2>

    <p>Voice and speech recognition are two separate <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics" title="biometric" target="_blank">biometric</a></u> modalities that, because they are dependent on the human
        voice, see a considerable amount of synergy. Both are contactless, software-based technologies, and as such are
        counted among the most convenient biometrics in regular use. The first step to understanding this kind of
        biometrics is to make the key distinction between voice and speech recognition. A system&#39;s ability to
        process &quot;what a person is saying&quot; - and speaker verification, &quot;technology based on individual
        vocal physiology and behavior to validate a claim of identity.&quot; In fact, speech recognition is a user
        interface technology that by measuring the sounds a user makes while speaking can measure the unique biological
        factors that, combined, produce her voice. According to a Unisys survey, the biometric measures ranked by
        consumer preference are voice recognition (32%), fingerprints (27%), facial scan (20%), hand geometry (12%), and
        iris scan (10%). This ranking seems to confirm that people prefer convenience and familiarity when choosing a
        biometric technology.</p>

    <p>In today&rsquo;s increasingly mobile and connected world, having hands free interface options is critical. Voice
        recognition technology also called voice command, allows users to interact with and control technologies by
        speaking to them. <strong>Speech recognition technologies</strong> are changing the world around us. With the
        rise of the <u><a href="https://www.palizafzar.com/en/articles/internet-of-things-iot/" title="Internet of Things" target="_blank">internet of things</a></u>, voice recognition is finding a niche. Always on speech recognition is making
        today&rsquo;s mobile devices easier to use than ever before. Speech technologies are creating amazing
        opportunities for today&rsquo;s organizations and are strengthening other biometric login solutions.</p>

    <h2>How do speech and voice recognition work?</h2>

    <p>Voice recognition technology is possible after making a digital model of an individual&#39;s voice that can serve
        as a stored profile or template of that voiceprint. Words and phrases are broken down into various kinds of
        frequency patterns that, taken together, describe someone&#39;s unique way of speaking. The templates are stored
        in databases for matching like other kinds of biometric data.</p>

    <p class="mar-btm-30">These systems can be text-dependent or text-independent (and sometimes a combination) and
        used, for example, to control access and <a href="https://www.palizafzar.com/en/" target="_blank"
            title="time &amp; attendance"><strong>time &amp; attendance</strong></a>. For the first option, numbers or
        phrases can become spoken passwords that can be compared to a sample of those same words that were acquired
        during enrolment. Text independent technology does not require a passphrase but analyzes the speaker&#39;s free
        speech for unique vocal characteristics.</p>

    <h2>Practical applications of speech recognition:</h2>

    <ul class="mar-btm-30">
        <li>All voice and speech recognition needs are a microphone to listen. Chances are you have voice recognition on
            your personal mobile device. Each of Microsoft&rsquo;s Cortana and Android&rsquo;s OK Google can perform
            searches and basic tasks based on voice command.</li>
        <li>When it comes to protecting physical access, speaker verification can be used, for instance, to log
            warehouse employees with voice data collection systems as they move about an environment during work. Speech
            verification combined with GPS is also being used to keep track of security guards to make sure they are
            making their rounds, and not relying on friends to do it for them.</li>
        <li>The USAA banking app, for example, uses facial recognition and voice recognition to provide easy and secure
            multi-factor biometric security, the voice component adding an extra level of liveness detection to the
            process.</li>
        <li>Since all types of biometric applications on the rise, voice-based authentication is one approach that seems
            to engender less resistance among users than other biometric forms of security. Voice recognition is
            non-contact, non-intrusive, and easy to use.</li>
        <li>Voice recognition for authentication is increasingly being found in call centers. Swisscom, one of
            Switzerland&rsquo;s biggest telecoms, recently implemented voice recognition in its call centers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Challenges with speech recognition:</h2>

    <p>Variety challenges affect its accuracy. These include poor quality voice samples. The variability in a
        speaker&#39;s voice due to illness, mood, and changes over time; background noise as the caller interacts with
        the system; and changes in the call&#39;s technology (digital vs. analog, upgrades to circuits and microphones,
        etc.)</p>
