    <h2><strong>What is a UPS?</strong></h2>

    <p class="mar-btm-30">An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is an electrical apparatus that provides emergency power
        to a load when the input power source or mains power fails. A UPS differs from an auxiliary or emergency power
        system or standby generator. It will provide near-instantaneous protection from input power interruptions by
        supplying energy stored in batteries, supercapacitors, or flywheels.</p>

    <h2><strong>UPS Components</strong></h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Rectifier:</strong> This part of the UPS converts the incoming alternating current (AC) supply to
            direct current (DC) and can provide charging current for the battery and the inverter&#39;s supply
            requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Charger:</strong> In several UPS systems, a separate battery charger is used due to its design
            nature.</li>
        <li><strong>Battery:</strong> This is the power storage section and is kept charged either by the rectifier or a
            separate charger. Its storage capacity is generally displayed as Ah (ampere-hour), which is the number of
            current amperes that the battery can supply for an hour.</li>
        <li><strong>Inverter: </strong> This section of the Uninterruptible power supply provides an AC output to the
            load,
            which is in phase with the input mains supply. Due to the number of conversions (AC to DC to AC) and the
            filtering involved, it can be termed a &lsquo;clean supply.&rsquo;</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><strong>Types of UPS</strong></h2>

    <ul>

        <li><strong>Offline/standby UPS:</strong> An offline/standby UPS offers only the most basic features, providing
            surge
            protection and battery backup. The protected equipment is usually connected directly to incoming utility
            power. When the incoming voltage falls below or rises above a predetermined level, the SPS(Standby Power
            Supply) turns on its internal DC-AC inverter circuitry, powered by an internal storage battery. The SPS then
            mechanically switches the connected equipment onto its DC-AC inverter output. The switchover time can be as
            long as 25 milliseconds depending on the amount of time it takes the standby UPS to detect the lost utility
            voltage. The UPS will be designed for specific power equipment, such as a personal computer, without any
            objectionable dip or brownout to that device.</li>

        <li><strong>Online/double-conversion UPS:</strong> An online UPS is ideal for environments where electrical
            isolation is necessary or equipment sensitive to power fluctuations. The online UPS' initial cost may be
            higher, but its total cost of ownership is generally lower due to longer battery life. The online UPS may be
            necessary when the power environment is "noisy," when utility power sags, outages, and other anomalies are
            frequent when protecting sensitive IT equipment loads is required, or operation from an extended-run backup
            generator is necessary.</li>

        <li><strong>Line-interactive UPS:</strong> A line-interactive UPS is similar in function to a standby UPS, but
            with the
            addition of a multi-tap variable-voltage autotransformer. This is a particular type of transformer that can
            add or subtract powered coils of wire, thereby increasing or decreasing the magnetic field and the
            transformer&#39;s output voltage. This is also known as a Buck-boost transformer. This type of UPS can
            tolerate continuous under-voltage brownouts and overvoltage surges without consuming the limited reserve
            battery power. It instead compensates by automatically selecting different power taps on the
            autotransformer.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><strong>What is UPS Bypass mode?</strong></h2>

    <p class="mar-btm-30">UPS Bypass mode is when you switch the circuit from going through the UPS to going around or
        bypassing it. A manual bypass switch is used to remove the UPS system from the circuit for servicing or
        maintenance or no longer working correctly. An automatic transfer switch functions in the same way as a manual
        but will automatically switch the UPSs load to mains electric if the UPS experiences an internal failure.</p>

    <h2><strong>UPS Battery of time and attendance system:</strong></h2>

    <p class="mar-btm-30">When the time and attendance device is connected to power, the internal UPS battery starts
        charging. When the main emphasis is cut off, at the same time, the relay automatically allows the internal
        battery to be used without interruption to maintain the <a href="https://www.palizafzar.com/en/products/tx/"
            target="_blank" title="time and attendance device"><strong>time and attendance device</strong></a>. The
        charge time duration of a UPS battery lasts from 6 to 8 hours depending on the availability of time and
        attendance device and between 8 and 20 hours providing the time attendance device until it turns off.</p>

    <h2><strong>The UPS batteries are used in time and attendance devices:</strong></h2>

    <ul class="mar-btm-30">
        <li>Nickel-cadmium battery 7.4 volt for PF and Timax time and attendance devices version: 2&amp;3</li>
        <li>Lithium batteries 7.4 volts for Timax time and attendance devices version: 4&amp;5</li>
        <li>Batteries 11.2 volts for Virdi time and attendance devices</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><strong>How long are UPS batteries usable when the power has been cut off?</strong></h2>

    <ul class="mar-btm-30">
        <li>Timax fingerprint time and attendance battery provide 26 hours for standby mode and 8 hours for outstanding
            sensor and device use.</li>
        <li>The ZK uFace 102 face recognition time and attendance device&#39;s battery provides 4 hours for standby mode
            and 2 hours for outstanding sensor and device use.</li>
    </ul>
