    <p>Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is a model for managing digital identities in which an individual has sole
        ownership over the ability to control their accounts and personal data. In all models of identity management, a
        digital identity requires identifiers, which ensure the user is who they say they are. However, with
        self-sovereign identity, identifiers do not need an intermediary. This means that a user&rsquo;s self-sovereign
        identity can be registered to a claim, such as a block on a <u><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain" target="_blank"
                title="blockchain">blockchain&lt;</a>.</u> The person can then share that identifying data when making a
        transaction with a bank, for example. Self-sovereign identity systems use blockchains so that decentralized
        identifiers can be looked up without involving a central directory.</p>

    <p>One of the first references to identity sovereignty occurred in February 2012, when developer Moxie Marlinspike
        wrote about &ldquo;Sovereign Source Authority&rdquo;. He said that individuals &ldquo;have an established Right
        to an &lsquo;identity&rsquo;&rdquo;, but that national registration destroys that sovereignty. It was one of
        several &quot;personal cloud&quot; initiatives that appeared around the same time.</p>

    <p>Individuals with self-sovereign identity can store their data to their devices and provide it for verification
        and transactions without the need to rely upon a central repository of data. With self-sovereign identity, users
        have complete control over how their personal information is kept and used.</p>

    <p class="mar-btm-30">With self-sovereign identity, a person can enter an app on their phone where their identity
        data is stored, then use an identification number and identity information to verify who they are.
        Self-sovereign identity adds security and flexibility to the user and allows them the ability to share data only
        when they choose.</p>

    <h2><strong>Guiding Principles of SSI</strong></h2>

    <ul class="mar-btm-30 list-unstyled mar-left-30">
        <li>Existence &mdash; Users must have an independent existence.</li>
        <li>Control &mdash; Users must control their identities.</li>
        <li>Access &mdash; Users must have access to their own data</li>
        <li>Transparency &mdash; Systems and algorithms must be transparent.</li>
        <li>Persistence &mdash; Identities must be long-lived.</li>
        <li>Portability &mdash; Information and services about identity must be transportable</li>
        <li>Interoperability &mdash; Identities should be as widely usable as possible.</li>
        <li>Consent &mdash; Users must agree to the use of their identity.</li>
        <li>Minimization &mdash; Disclosure of claims must be minimized</li>
        <li>Protection &mdash; the rights of users must be protected</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><strong>Self-sovereign identity structure</strong></h2>

    <p class="mar-btm-10">Self-sovereign identity is made up of claims, proofs, and attestations:</p>

    <ul class="mar-btm-30">
        <li>A claim is an assertion of identity made by the user.</li>
        <li>Proofs are the forms or documents that act as evidence for a claim. So, for example, proof could be a
            passport or birth certificate.</li>
        <li>An attestation, or validation, is when the other party validates the claim is true. Attestations can be
            stored in the user&rsquo;s device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><strong>Some pros to using self-sovereign identity include:</strong></h2>

    <ul class="mar-btm-30">
        <li>It is more secure and prevents common attacks to personal data, such as breaches.</li>
        <li>Data is more private.</li>
        <li>Users have higher control over their own data.</li>
        <li>The process is more efficient.</li>
        <li>Users do not have to rely on other identity providers who may sell and monetize your data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><strong>Cons of self-sovereign identity include:</strong></h2>

    <ul class="mar-btm-30">
        <li>Users are responsible for their own security.</li>
        <li>Keeping track of personal data and permissions can become complex.</li>
        <li>Certain data intermediaries may not be able to be removed.</li>
        <li>Proof data is normally unstructured and could be easily faked.</li>
        <li>There could be multiple identity platforms, meaning users may have to use multiple apps.</li>
    </ul>
