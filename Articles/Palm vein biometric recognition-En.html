    <p class="mar-btm-20">Palm vein biometric authentication system based on palm vein pattern recognition, has been known to be one of the most accurate biometric authentication solutions currently available. From security systems for the average family home to the protection of personal information, anti-theft devices for cars and other vehicles, world-wide anti-terrorist systems, relatively safe, and low-risk security systems are being sought in a large variety of fields. Palm secure provides a high level of accuracy, is easy to implement and uses. As veins are internal and have a wealth of differentiating features, attempts to forge an identity are extremely difficult, thereby enabling a high-security level.</p>
    <p>Biometrics is a technology that uses physical or behavioral characteristics of people to identify them. The physical signs are fingerprints, palm vein, palm print, face, Iris, and ear. Behavioral features are including speech, hand movements, and gait.</p>
    <h2><strong>The characteristics of useful biometrics are:</strong></h2>
    <ul class="mar-btm-30">
        <li>Low cost and ease of implementation.</li>
        <li>Resistance to various types of attacks</li>
        <li>Unique features for each individual</li>
        <li>Precise algorithms enabling classification</li>
        <li>Invariant traits over time (e.g., due to the effect of aging)</li>
        <li>Features that are relatively easy to obtain (computational complexity small)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><strong>Advantages of multi biometric systems:</strong></h2>
    <ul class="mar-btm-30">
        <li>Thanks to many independent biometric features that are difficult to attack, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometric_device" title="multi-biometric device" target="_blank">multi-biometric device</a> ensures greater accuracy and reliability.</li>
        <li>Continuous monitoring: If one biometric modality obstructs, other patterns of the multi-biometric system ensure correct user identification.</li>
        <li>Privacy: Multi biometric systems provide higher resistance to certain types of loopholes and attacks. It is difficult and impossible to steal many biometric patterns (templates) stored in the biometric database.</li>
    </ul>
   
    <h2><strong>What is palm vein authentication?</strong></h2>
    <p>Thanks to reductions in size, reductions in cost, and simplification of development, palm vein technology can be used in various situations. It is very hygienic and stress-free for even public use,  because of its contactless feature. It captures your vein pattern instantly by hold your palm over the <a href="https://www.palizafzar.com/en/" title="time attendance device" target="_blank"><strong>time attendance device</strong></a>. Not only can everyone use it, but it is also tricky to forgery the palm vein data because it is inside the body.  A variety of practical applications and possibilities are anticipated using these features, and this section introduces these one at a time.</p>

    <h2><strong>Uses of palm vein biometric recognition:</strong></h2>
    <div class="mar-left-30 mar-top-20">

        <h2>Using palm vein biometric systems in banks:</h2>
        <p class="mar-btm-20">Palm vein authentication systems have already started to be utilized by financial institutions. The application to automatic payment machines has been implemented in two ways, through the introduction of ATMs equipped with an identity verification function that uses contactless vein authentication and new account service for customers who so desire. When a customer opens a new account at the teller, a dedicated device is used to register the palm vein pattern of the person, who can then skip authentication procedures using objects such as personal seals and cash cards, even when withdrawing cash. It removes the hassle of having to handle an object and effectively stops the crime from occurring due to loss or theft. Suruga Bank has introduced a palm vein system, and a move towards the former ATMs has begun in every financial institution, starting with the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi (BTM) is a leading commercial bank in Japan. It offers an extensive scope of commercial, investment, and trust banking products as well as services to businesses, governments, and individuals worldwide.</p>
        <p>A survey was carried out on approximately 1,000 regular customers visiting a bank using a demonstration machine. As a result, in response to the question "Out of fingerprints and veins, which authentication method do you think is most appropriate?" 57% of people chose vein authentication, and 37% of people chose fingerprints. In addition, employee log-in using palm vein authentication is also anticipated to grow in the banking industry. Using palm vein authentication instead of the current ID and Password-based system when logging into PCs and other systems, banks can prevent illegal access, allowing the bank to manage critical information such as customer data.</p>

        <h2>Using palm vein biometric systems at work:</h2>
        <p>Not only palm vein authentication is suitable for office entrance and exits. It can also be employed in a wide range of security room management and security applications, such as the doors to laboratories that only allow certain personnel, and managing entrance and exit at factories where a large number of employees work in shifts. Log-in systems to PCs and applications using palm vein authentication are being implemented in office environments. This system saves employees from entering IDs and Passwords, allowing them to log-in by merely placing their palms over the Palm Secure device. It becomes unnecessary for these employees to remember multiple IDs and Passwords, increasing security in the offices by preventing impersonators from logging in.</p>

        <h2>Using palm vein biometric systems in government departments:</h2>
        <p>Government facilities in need of managing various classified information have high expectations for biometrics-based login systems. There is currently a move towards authentication by using biometric data to prevent the entrance of unauthorized or dangerous people into office space in particular such as buildings for government departments and public facilities. As while an even more rigorous check than for typical buildings is required in these situations, investigations have been made into combining two or more authentication systems, such as fingerprint and iris scan, or vein and voiceprint. In Europe and North America, such systems are already being introduced into the offices of securities markets, parks, etc.</p>

        <h2>Using palm vein biometric systems at airports:</h2>
        <p>Airports are a gateway to foreign countries. In the same way as the entrance checks for buildings, the security systems within airports continue to undergo rapid changes. In the European Union, where there is an urgent need for unification of counterterrorism measures, attempts have begun to prevent the immigration of dangerous people and counterfeit passports by combining biometrics technology.</p>
        <p>Additionally, to be used in employee identification passes and gate passes for airport personnel, in Japan, the use in boarding passes is also being investigated to prevent crime on domestic flights. Authentication data for dangerous people and people with a criminal record is registered in advance in the system, making it possible to determine in real-time while at the same time as performing the regular customer check when one of these people attempts to enter the country.</p>
        <p>Now, Korea airport corporation has deployed Fujitsu’s biometric palm vein authentication system to all 14 domestic airports under its jurisdiction. The system began operation on December 28, 2018, and has been used more than a million times by 160,000 individuals with registered palm vein patterns. Passenger identity is confirmed with biometrics instead of the citizen ID card, which was previously required. According to the announcement, the automated process both improves the accuracy of identification and significantly shortens the time taken for the procedure.</p>

        <h2>Using palm vein biometric systems in apartments and houses:</h2>
        <p>One way that palm vein authentication is being used is through integration with various modern security systems for houses and apartments by being fitted as an unlocking device at the front entrance. The owner of the building is free to install any system, and a variety of biometric technologies have already been investigated for regular homes. The contactless vein authentication system where the user merely holds out their hand is extremely suitable as an unlocking device to the point that it does not place unnecessary stress on the user. It parallels the office systems and is one area where the most growth is anticipated in the future.</p>

    <h2>Advantages of palm vein biometric:</h2>
    <p>The pattern of blood veins is unique to every individual and will not vary over the course of a person's lifetime. The fact that this pattern lies under the skin makes it almost impossible for others to read, so palm-vein pattern biometrics are necessarily a secure method of verification. Fujitsu's sampling test showed a result that the false acceptance rate was 0.013%.</p>
