<h2 class="h3 text-primary">Three-Dimensional Facial Recognition Systems</h2>

<p>Three-dimensional face recognition systems use three-dimensional sensors to gain information about facial shapes. This information is used to identify distinctive features on the surface of faces, such as eyes, nose, and chin.</p>

<h2 class="h3 text-primary">Face Time Attendance Systems vs. Fingerprint Time Attendance Systems</h2>

<ul class="mb-5">
<li>Saving time and reducing disease: When diseases such as colds and viruses spread among employees can reduce the presence of employees at work. Employees can enter and exit in a shorter time using a face recognition attendance device because there is no need to touch the surface of the time attendance device. It saves time and also minimizes the spread of diseases due to physical contact.</li>
<li>Face time attendance devices can be helpful in workshop environments, industrial sectors, buildings, and all the environments that people haven&#39;t healthy fingerprints according to their work or use physical of his body to do tasks. But in places such as office environments, government organs, that work environment is healthy and without concern and involvement of body organs, using a fingerprint time attendance device can be a good choice for access control.</li>
<li>Face recognition time attendance devices have more passing through records than fingerprint time attendance devices, and it can be a good choice for places with more than 100 personnel. Still, in small offices with less staff, the use of fingerprint time attendance devices will be economically more economical.</li>

Face recognition time attendance devices record facial features and save recorded patterns in a database or a device memory. When employees stand in front of the attendance device, it receives the face employee and performs a three-dimensional or two-dimensional analysis of facial points that is unique to each employee; then, an adaptive pattern is obtained with predefined patterns. When authentication is successful, devices confirm employees' identity, and their entrance or exit time will be registered. Otherwise, the act of identifying a person is not successful."}}]}</script><script type="application/ld+json">{"@context": "https://schema.org","@type": "Organization","name": "Palizafzar Corp","url": "https://www.palizafzar.com/","logo": "https://static.palizafzar.com/static/images/paliz_logo.png","sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/PalizafzarCorp/","https://twitter.com/palizafzar","https://www.instagram.com/palizafzarco/","https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnLtCo1f5fRrNW0wA4PR7yA","https://www.linkedin.com/company/palizafzar","https://www.pinterest.com/palizafzar/","https://telegram.me/palizafzar_co","https://www.aparat.com/palizafzar"]}</script>
