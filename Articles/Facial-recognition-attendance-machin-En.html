<p>Like biometric access control systems, facial recognition time and attendance are designed to identify employees&#39; unique physiological features. Many technology companies, especially Apple, Samsung, and Google, integrate biometric authentication with their hardware. Unlike card-based time and attendance systems, employees cannot register their traffic logs instead of each other through <a href="https://www.palizafzar.com/en/articles/biometric-time-attendance-system/" target="_blank" title="biometric time and attendance systems"><u>biometric time and attendance systems</u></a>, particularly face, fingerprint, palm, and iris recognition.</p>

<h2 class="mar-top-40" id="WhatAre"><strong>What Are Face Recognition Time and Attendance Systems?</strong></h2>

<p class="mar-btm-30">Face recognition time and attendance machines are the newest technology-based security solutions that they provide security at the workplace by recognizing facial features. Face recognition time attendance devices record facial features and save recorded patterns in a database or a device memory. When employees stand in front of the attendance device, it receives the face employee and performs a three-dimensional or two-dimensional analysis of facial points that is unique to each employee; then, an adaptive pattern is obtained with predefined patterns. When authentication is successful, devices confirm employees&#39; identity, and their entrance or exit time will be registered. Otherwise, the act of identifying a person is not successful.</p>

<li>Saving time and reducing disease: When diseases such as colds and viruses spread among employees can reduce the presence of employees at work. Employees can enter and exit in a shorter time using a face recognition attendance device because there is no need to touch the surface of the time attendance device. It saves time and also minimizes the spread of diseases due to physical contact.</li>
<li>Face time attendance devices can be helpful in workshop environments, industrial sectors, buildings, and all the environments that people haven&#39;t healthy fingerprints according to their work or use physical of his body to do tasks. But in places such as office environments, government organs, that work environment is healthy and without concern and involvement of body organs, using a fingerprint time attendance device can be a good choice for access control.</li>
<li>Face recognition time attendance devices have more passing through records than fingerprint time attendance devices, and it can be a good choice for places with more than 100 personnel. Still, in small offices with less staff, the use of fingerprint time attendance devices will be economically more economical.</li>

<h2 id="History"><strong>History of Most Important Face Recognition Events</strong></h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>1960 - Face recognition becomes semi-automated</strong> The first semi-automatic face recognition system was developed by Woodrow W. Bledsoe under contract to the US Government. This system required the administrator to locate features such as eyes, ears, nose, and mouth on the photographs. This system relied solely on the ability to extract useable feature points. It calculated distances and ratios to a common reference point that was compared to the reference data.</li>
<li><strong>1970 - Face Recognition takes another step towards automation.</strong> Goldstein, Harmon, and Lesk used 21 specific subjective markers such as hair color and lip thickness to automate face recognition. The problem with both of these early solutions was that the measurements and locations were manually computed.</li>
<li><strong>1993 - FacE REcognition Technology (FERET) program is initiated</strong> The FacE REcogntion Technology (FERET) Evaluation was sponsored from 1993-1997 by the Defense Advanced Research Products Agency (DARPA) and the DoD Counterdrug Technology Development Program Office in an effort to encourage the development of face recognition algorithms and technology. This evaluation assessed the prototypes of face recognition systems and propelled face recognition from its infancy to a market of commercial products.</li>
<li><strong>1994 - First iris recognition algorithm is patented</strong> Dr. John Daugman was awarded a patent for his iris recognition algorithms.

Today, many technology companies, especially Apple, Samsung, and Google, integrate biometric authentication with their hardware. Unlike card-based time and attendance systems, employees cannot register their traffic logs instead of each other through biometric time and attendance systems, particularly face, fingerprint, palm, and iris recognition."}</script><script type="application/ld+json">{"@context": "https: //schema.org","@type": "FAQPage","mainEntity": [{"@type": "Question","name": "What Are Face Recognition Time and Attendance Systems?","acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer","text": "Face recognition time and attendance machines are the newest technology-based security solutions that they provide security at the workplace by recognizing facial features. Face recognition time attendance devices record facial features and save recorded patterns in a database or a device memory. When employees stand in front of the attendance device, it receives the face employee and performs a three-dimensional or two-dimensional analysis of facial points that is unique to each employee; then, an adaptive pattern is obtained with predefined patterns. When authentication is successful, devices confirm employees' identity, and their entrance or exit time will be registered. Otherwise, the act of identifying a person is not successful."}}]}</script><script type="application/ld+json">{"@context": "https://schema.org","@type": "Organization","name": "Palizafzar Corp","url": "https://www.palizafzar.com/","logo": "https://static.palizafzar.com/static/images/paliz_logo.png","sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/PalizafzarCorp/","https://twitter.com/palizafzar","https://www.instagram.com/palizafzarco/","https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnLtCo1f5fRrNW0wA4PR7yA","https://www.linkedin.com/company/palizafzar","https://www.pinterest.com/palizafzar/","https://telegram.me/palizafzar_co","https://www.aparat.com/palizafzar"]}</script>
