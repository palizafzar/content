</ol>
<h3 id="Traditional">Traditional Key-Based Systems</h3>
<p>These systems use mechanical keys to allow or deny entry to a premises. While still popular, they are less secure than modern electronic systems.</p>
<h3 id="Electronic">Electronic Systems</h3>
<p>Electronic systems like PIN codes and swipe cards are more common nowadays. These grant access to specific individuals and can restrict access according to assigned schedules.</p>
<h3 id="Biometric">Biometric Access Control Systems</h3>
<p>Sensors scan biometric identifiers like fingerprints, iris patterns or faces to identify and grant access to individuals.</p>

<h3 id="Authentication">Authentication</h3>
<p>The user presents a credential to be checked against preset conditions such as time, location, and level of security.</p>
<h3 id="Authorization">Authorization</h3>
<p>If the credentials pass the authentication test, the user is granted entry into premises according to his/ her assigned access permissions.</p>
<h3 id="MonitoringManagement">Monitoring and Management</h3>
<p>The system owner can monitor and manage access records, issued credentials, log activities, and updates access permissions.</p>
