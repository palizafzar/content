<h2><strong>AC-5000 IK Fingerprint and Card Access Control Systems</strong></h2>

<p>Most fingerprint readers are just traditional readers, lacking friendly interfaces. That&rsquo;s why Virdi has built a color LCD on the AC5000, whose display is customizable. Thus, companies can load graphics, especially their firm logos. The sparkling display also shows DateTime, status, and system messages. Therefore it will be smooth to configure and manage the device. AC5000 is tightly covered for maximum weatherproof and durability. It has been verified as dust-proof and 100% tight against water projected at it from any direction. Therefore, this access control fits outdoor installation and ideal for dusty environments such as construction sites and unsheltered lobbies. The AC5000 fingerprint attendance system can either be set up as a stand-alone scanner or combined by your local area network to server terminals, including access control and time management systems.</p>
