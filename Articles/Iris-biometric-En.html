    <p>Today, many characteristics are used as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics" target="_blank"
            title="biometrics"><u>biometrics</u></a> in real-world applications, the most important of which include
        faces, hand veins, fingerprints, palm prints, iris, and voice patterns.</p>

    <p>Iris recognition is the automatic process of biometric recognition that uses mathematical pattern-recognition
        algorithms on still images of a person's eyes, whose facial patterns are highly distinguishable and stable that
        can easily be spotted from a distance. This technology will surely increase the accuracy of biometric
        authentication systems and make them more practical and valuable. Retinal scanning is performed with another
        ocular-based biometric technology, which is often confused with iris recognition. Most of the time, biometrics
        used in iris recognition applications are extracted from physical <a

    <h2><strong>Iris Recognition Systems</strong></h2>

    <p><strong>Iris recognition</strong> system uses video camera technology in access control solutions, providing
        subtle infrared illumination to capture details rich in the iris&#39; intricate structure visible from the
        outside. Digital
        templates that encode these patterns into mathematical and statistical algorithms provide someone to pretend to
        be an individual. <strong>iris recognition</strong> allows security and law enforcement agencies to identify
        individuals in real-time without the need to capture or record electronically.</p>

    <p>Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University in the US have shown they could use a computer program to identify a
        driver by taking a picture of his eyes from his vehicle&#39;s side mirror. The latest development in this field
        is developing a real-time <strong>iris recognition</strong> system (IRIS) by the University of California,
        Berkeley.</p>

    <p>Biometrics are considered highly secure for the identification of individuals as they are distinctive.
        Furthermore, it is challenging to be forged. Moreover, biometrics are very convenient in their usage because
        they can&#39;t be stolen or forgotten somewhere. The main usage of biometrics within smart projects is mainly
        related to data access control, i.e., through the checking of biometrics, some users can be granted or denied
        access to the protected service or information. It is a general belief that the usage of biometrics is the
        perfect solution for all identification problems.</p>

    <p>An iris has a texture, which is randomly determined in the embryonic stage and fingerprints. Iris textures have
        been used as a human identifier for some time now. They are considered one of the most reliable ways to
        distinguish a human from another. It is considered one of the most reliable because it is an internal and
        practically invariant organ for a lifetime. It is a flat organ, and its diameter changes only with the
        pupil&#39;s contraction and dilation. It is actually a recent biometrics. It is already being used in various
        security systems worldwide, such as the United Arab Emirates, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, Canadian Air Transport
        Security Authority, etc. Market researchers have predicted biometric smartphones will reach 100% adoption by
        2020, and the recent Samsung smartphone Galaxy Note 7 is already featuring biometric <strong>iris
            recognition</strong> to market.</p>

    <p>The above image shows the parts of the eye that need to be considered when comparing Irises. Another benefit of
        Iris biometric usage is the distance of capture, making the touch of the reading equipment not necessary. Most
        equipment operates from 10cm to few meters. However, this brings difficulty for the verification of <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics" target="_blank" title="biometrics">biometrics</a>. This
        distance, which on the one hand, is comfortable, results in an image that requires some processing before
        obtaining the Iris template. This process usually results in an error during the matching process; another
        source of error comes from the number of obstacles that may prevent the correct capture of the Iris as the
        eyelids and eyelashes. Since it may be possible to detect Iris by mistake, a group of students with names
        Nedjah, R. S. Wyant, L. M. Mourelle, and B. B. Gupta from State University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Department
        of Computer Engineering, In 2017, they presented an article in which biometric details of the Iris are recorded
        on unique <a href="https://www.palizafzar.com/en/articles/contacless-card/" target="_blank" title="smart cards"><u>smart cards</u></a> and the matching of individuals when they are identified and processed by it.</p>
