    <p>IoT, which stands for the Internet of Things, is a new concept in technology and communication. In 1999, Kevin
        Ashton used the Internet of Things, which described a world in which everything, including inanimate objects,
        has its own digital identity, and computers allow devices, items, and gadgets to organize and manage.</p>
    <p>Today, although the Internet connects to all people, all things are associated with IoT. In the Internet of
        things, billions or trillions of objects can communicate and interact with the surrounding environment to
        exchange information.</p>
    <h2><strong>What Is IoT – Internet of Things?</strong></h2>
    <p>The Internet of Things is a network that connects physical things to the Internet and other networks via uniquely
        identifiable IP addresses, allowing data to be collected and exchanged via embedded sensors, electronics, and
        software.</p>
    <p>In IoT technology, a unique ID and an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address" title="IP address"
            target="_blank"><u>IP address</u></a> are assigned for each object, which can send data to a specific
        database. </p>
    <p>While the Internet of Items begins with a network of linked things, its advantages and disadvantages are mostly
        tied to the network technologies, systems, and applications that are developed on this underlying layer.</p>
    <p>Things can range from consumer-oriented gadgets such as wearables and smart home solutions (Consumer IoT) to enterprise-connected equipment (Enterprise IoT) and industrial assets such as machines, robots, or even humans in smart factories and industrial facilities (Industrial IoT).</p>
        <p>The Internet of Things technology plays a crucial role in the entrepreneurial world. Several businesses have been
        launched based on the Internet of Things technology. While IoT technology is at the beginning of its way, using
        IoT technology is a precious opportunity for entrepreneurs and creative researchers which can help to improve
        business and job creation.</p>

    <h2><strong>What Is the Usage of IoT?</strong></h2>
    <ul class="list-unstyled mar-btm-30">
        <li>By using IoT technology can smartly to control and manage parts of a city, industry and home. One of the
            main goals of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_automation" title="smart home"
                target="_blank"><u>smart home</u></a>s is more control and smart security in a home or a big building.
            In fact,
            by using Internet of Things and applications based on web or mobile, we can manage and control smart home
            and in this way to have better security. </li>
        <li>In the IoT technology many sensors such as temperature sensors, pressure gauges, seismic, light meter,
            moisture meter and sensor to measure stress work over the internet. The presence of sensors is caused to
            make things happen by ourselves instead of reacting to our surroundings.</li>
        <li>Many patients are very keen on small devices that work over the Internet, to help doctors to identifying the
            causes of their disease. Also small sensors connected to internet can be use on plants, animals, and other
            earth features and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermostat" title="Thermostat"
                target="_blank"><u>thermostat</u></a>. Nest thermostat allow you to control ambient temperature from
            your smart
            phone. With using this feature you can save power consumption, even turn off your home ventilation system
            from your workplace.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><strong>ُSecurity on IoT</strong></h2>
    <p class="mar-btm-30">Many reputable companies have announced user’s privacy has become one of the main targets in
        this field. For example, Apple requires the developer companies of products based on the platform <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HomeKit" title="HomeKit" target="_blank"><u>HomeKit</u></a> to benefit
        from
        special encryption feature. Also this company announced not to be collected any data from users in this field.
    </p>
    <h2><strong>The Challenges Facing the Internet of Things</strong></h2>
    <div class="mar-left-20">
        <h3>Development of IPv6</h3>
        <p>Development of IPv6: While using of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4" title="IPv4"
                target="_blank"><u>IPv4</u></a> addresses was abandoned in February, 2010, but in fact it did not
            happen.
            Although IPv6 has many advantages such as create infinite an unique IP, but there are many devices that
            do not support IPv6.</p>
        <h3>Power sensors</h3>
        <p>Power sensors: imagine are supposed to replace battery billions of sensors on different levels of planet
            earth, clearly it is impossible. What is needed is to find a way through natural and environmental that via
            it sensors can produce their energy through vibration, light or air currents.</p>
        <h3>Agree on Standards</h3>
        <p>Agree on Standards: While most developments have created at standard course, but more is needed than
            current progress especially in areas such as security, privacy, architecture, and communications. <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers" title="IEEE"
                target="_blank"><u>IEEE</u></a> organization is trying to make IPv6 packages secure trough which can
            identified and tracked various types of network.</p>
    </div>
    <h2><strong>What Companies Work on IoT technology?</strong></h2>
    <p class="mar-btm-30">For now, companies such as Samsung, LG, Apple, Google and Philips already work on the
        connected
        devices to each other and Countless small companies are also involved in research in this field. Based
        on
        research done is expected to be 4.9 billion device to be used in this year, and this digit will arrive
        to 25
        billion until 2020.</p>
    <h2><strong>What Time Is Suitable to Buy IoT-Based Devices?</strong></h2>
    <p class="mar-btm-30">Consider that before purchasing IoT-based products, do enough research and then buy them from
        reliable companies. Always keep in mind this example that the Internet of Things can help your children to
        arrive safely.</p>
