    <p>ANPR stands for Automatic Number Plate Recognition ANPR, is an exact system capable of reading vehicle number
        plates without human interrupting through the use of high-speed image capture with supporting illumination,
        pattern classification inside the images given, <strong>vehicle license plate verification</strong> of character
        sequences,
        character recognition for the image to text translation. Consequently, it would provide a metadata collection
        that describes an image bearing a license plate for a car
        and the decoded text associated with that plate.</p>

    <h2><strong>Components of ANPR system</strong></h2>

    <ul class="mar-btm-30">
        <li>ANPR camera for taking pictures</li>
        <li>ANPR software which is responsible for recognizing number plate from recorded images.</li>
        <li>Sometimes and depending on the condition use of specific hardware such as camera stand, roadblock.</li>

    <h2><strong>ANPR cameras</strong></h2>

    <p>The most important feature of the ANPR camera is the resolution of the image. Whatever we have high-quality
        photos, the ability to recognize number plate will be comfortable from the resulting images. The ANPR <u><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television" target="_blank"
                title="CCTV (Closed Circuit TelevVision)">CCTV (Closed Circuit TelevVision)</a></u> is divided into two
        types
        analog and digital. The CCTV Analog's maximum resolution that you give will be 720 TVL, equivalent to 0.5
        MP. These CCTV types were used for the first application with low cost in the past, But today&rsquo;s mostly
        used digital CCTVs to achieve better results and quality.</p>

    <h2><strong>WDR (Wide Dynamic Range)</strong></h2>

    <p>When part of an image is too dark, but another part is so bright you cannot&nbsp;see any details, dynamic
        range, and lighting difference. Cameras with a wide dynamic range (WDR) have special software that allows
        them to balance that lighting for one clear image. This makes them ideal for recording areas like store
        entrances where the contrast between the sunshine outside and the dim lighting inside can be challenging to
        record.</p>
    <p>Cameras have problems with underexposed and overexposed images because they can only accurately record the
        middle area of light between very dark and bright. Cameras with WDR technology have advanced sensors that
        can produce a broader range of lighting, allowing them to record higher light depth.</p>

    <h2><strong>Features of an ANPR system</strong></h2>

    <p>A strong ANPR system requires powerful and accurate <u><a href="https://www.palizafzar.com/en/products/parking/"
                title="parking software" target="_blank">parking software</a></u>. If only one character mistake to be
        identified from
        8 characters, in this case, an error occurs in ANPR. It causes the number plate to encounter an error in
        comparison with server information. After ensuring software, it is important to select&nbsp;an ANPR industrial
        CCTV with high precision. The ANPR system should be designed to have no&nbsp;problem reading number plates, and
        environmental conditions such as daylight and night light, rain, snow, fog, and cloudy weather do not affect it.
    </p>
    <p>Nowadays,&nbsp;CCTV uses HLC (High Light Compensation) technology to read the number plate at night. That <u><a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared" target="_blank" title="Infrared">infrared</a></u> radiates
        to the car's number plate at the entrance to parking so cameras can neutralize the effects of car lights and let
        reading number plate done easily. The range of reading ANPR varies depending on the CCTV. The highway ANPR
        usually supports up to 100 meters, and the parking ANPR supports about 3 to 10 meters.</p>

    <h2><strong>Advantages of ANPR software</strong></h2>

    <ul class="mar-btm-30">
        <li>You can make a report by applying various program options, such as the entrance and exit&nbsp;times of
            vehicles.</li>
        <li>About the number of vehicles entrance and exit get informed at 24hours/day.</li>
        <li>Cars recognizing have been parked for a long time.</li>
        <li>No need to issue cards for cars, as each number plate has an independent identity.</li>
        <li>To avoid relocating cars, the initial photo is provided at the ANPR system entrance when they are leaving
            parking.</li>
    </ul>
    <video controls class="full-block"
        src="https://www.namasha.com/videos/dl/7281255264-720p/%D8%B3%DB%8C%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%85_%DA%A9%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%84_%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%AF%D8%AF_%D9%BE%D8%A7%D8%B1%DA%A9%DB%8C%D9%86%DA%AF-720p.mp4"
        type="video/mp4" title="Smart parking system">Smart parking system</video>
    <h2><strong>The necessity of existing or remove operator in parking automation</strong></h2>

    <p>Considering we have no&nbsp;financial transaction on entrance the collection, the ANPR CCTV records time, date of
        entrance and number plate, and may entry bill do not need&nbsp;to be issued or if it requires a bill to be
        printed easily by the printer. Still, the presence of an operator is necessary when leaving public parking or
        the airport. Of course, electronic locations can be considered that people pay park fees when they are leaving,
        and after payment, a relay will be activated by the roadblock or doors to exit.</p>

    <h2><strong>Usage of ANPR system</strong></h2>

    <ul class="mar-btm-30">
        <li>In the parking of commercial complex, residential, Organizations, airports and public parking in the city
        </li>
        <li>As an <u><a href="https://www.palizafzar.com/en/product-categories/security-control-automation/"
                    title="access control" target="_blank">access control</a></u> in the intersection of streets and
            highways</li>
        <li>Stations receiving tolls electronically or by users</li>
        <li>The range of couple and individual traffic plans in the city</li>
        <li>Access control of vehicles from special lines such as tunnels and bus special lines</li>
        <li>Census of passing through cars to control traffic at the main entrances cities</li>
