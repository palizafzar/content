<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>Current Challenges in Ensuring Security and Data Integrity</h3>
<p>Despite technological advancements, traditional systems face challenges such as data breaches, tampering risks, and compliance with privacy regulations. Centralized storage increases the likelihood of unauthorized access and fraud.</p>

<h3>Introduction to Blockchain Technology and Its Potential Benefits</h3>
<p>Blockchain technology introduces a decentralized approach to data management. With features like immutability, transparency, and tamper-proof records, blockchain enhances the security and reliability of attendance and access control systems.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="blockchain-technology">
<h2>Understanding Blockchain Technology</h2>
<h3>Key Principles of Blockchain</h3>
<ul  class="mar-btm-30">
  <li><strong>Decentralization</strong>: Eliminates single points of failure by distributing data across multiple nodes.</li>
  <li><strong>Transparency</strong>: Ensures all transactions are verifiable and recorded in a public or private ledger.</li>
  <li><strong>Immutability</strong>: Prevents unauthorized changes to records, securing attendance and access data.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Types of Blockchains</h3>
<ul class="mar-btm-30">
  <li><strong>Public</strong>: Open and permissionless, ideal for broad transparency.</li>
  <li><strong>Private</strong>: Restricted access, suitable for enterprise-level attendance systems.</li>
  <li><strong>Consortium</strong>: Controlled by a group of organizations, balancing security and collaboration.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How Blockchain Ensures Secure Data Management</h3>
<p>By encrypting biometric data such as fingerprints or facial recognition scans, blockchain minimizes risks of tampering or unauthorized access, ensuring robust <strong>time attendance</strong> and <strong>access control systems</strong>.</p>
