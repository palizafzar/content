<p>One of the most commonly used&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics#:~:text=Biometrics%20are%20body%20measurements%20and,groups%20that%20are%20under%20surveillance." target="_blank" title="biometric">biometric</a> technologies is ADP time and attendance systems. Fingerprint time and attendance devices have earned popularity with businesses around the world. Nowadays, business owners have started replacing their old-<strong>time attendance systems</strong> with biometric time attendance and access control systems. Biometric technologies specify the individual physical characteristics of each employee. Using biometric time attendance machines, especially fingerprint and <a href="https://www.palizafzar.com/en/articles/facial-recognition-attendance-machin/" target="_blank" title="face time attendance devices">face time attendance devices</a>, ensure that the person is present at the workplace, and another person cannot be instead of them.</p>

<p>Biometric validation is unique to each person and cannot be fake or copied. Besides, it is known as the most accurate system for identifying each person. American Payroll Association estimates it takes about 5 to 6 minutes to manually total up and audit each employee&#39;s time card or timesheets. In contrast, you can reduce reading time to less than 1 second by using biometric <a href="https://www.palizafzar.com/en/categories/absence-automation/" target="_blank" title="time and attendance systems"><strong>time and attendance systems</strong></a>.</p>

<h2 class="mar-top-40" id="Identify"><strong>How to Identify Employees by Using Time and Attendance Systems?</strong></h2>

<p>When the staff put their finger on the fingerprint attendance device sensor, a time attendance device identifies points where the fingerprint intersects or ends and then creates a map of these points. This coordinate map is used as the biometric personnel for identification. <strong>ADP time and attendance</strong> devices compare taken fingerprints with available fingerprints in the database. If fingerprints match with preset patterns, the employee is correctly identified, and his clocking in or out will be enrolled. Otherwise, they do not recognize it.</p>

<h2 class="mar-top-40" id="Important"><strong>Why Is Time and Attendance Important?</strong></h2>

<p>Using Palizafzar&#39;s time and attendance systems, you are likely to ensure that personnel information is safe and secure entirely. Still, there are worries for personnel that do not forget or lose their attendance card in card time attendance systems. On the other hand, when managers are not present at the workplace, it involves their minds that another person may register his entrance instead of the owner&#39;s card. Palizafzar&#39;s <a href="https://www.palizafzar.com/en/articles/biometric-time-attendance-system/" target="_blank" title="biometric time and attendance systems">biometric time and attendance systems</a> are considered accessible to clock in and out.</p>

<h2 class="mar-top-40" id="Companies"><strong>What Kind of Companies Use Biometric Time Clocks?</strong></h2>

<p>Biometric time clocks can theoretically be used by any organization with the budget and need for them. The largest biometric time clock clients, according to one leading producer of fingerprint-based biometric time clocks, are businesses in the hotel, fuel, and hospitality industries.</p>

<h2 class="mar-top-40" id="Comparison"><strong>Fingerprint Attendance Devices vs. Card Attendance Devices</strong></h2>

<ul class="mar-btm-30">
<li>You cannot guess a fingerprint pattern in the <strong>fingerprint time and attendance systems</strong>; however, a password can be assumed in traditional attendance systems.</li>
<li>You cannot register your fingerprint instead of someone else in the fingerprint time attendance machines; by contrast, in card <strong>time attendance systems,</strong>&nbsp;personnel, additionally his card, may record another traffic log for someone.</li>
<li>You may forget your keyword in password-based attendance systems. Conversely, using biometric time and attendance devices, you always have biometric components--particularly fingerprint, facial, palm, and iris<strong>.</strong></li>

<li>Physiological features of fingerprint biometric cannot be repeated or forged. Observers and managers Always feel confident and satisfied that they can track and manage their employees&#39; time.</li>
<li>Work cost control and start saving money: According to the study, companies are without biometric devices; unfortunately, from 1.5% to 10% of the salary is overpaid due to employees&#39; waste of time and wrong computing. This loss can be more than 10,000$ a year for one ye using <strong>time attendance devices</strong>&nbsp;to eliminate calculation errors.</li>
<li>Biometric attendance machines remotely control employees&#39; presence. This technology can integrate with mobiles, the Internet, and <a href="https://www.palizafzar.com/en/products/web-time-attendance/" target="_blank" title="web-based time attendance software">web-based time attendance software</a>.

They can increase the productivity of active employees to a high degree.</li>
<li>Improving employee responsibility for managing time; Collecting data via <strong>time and attendance</strong> devices and software creates a specific audit document for time and number of days employees were present. They can manage time correctly and be answerable at work by improving the schedule.</li>
<li>Saving-time in payroll computing: The old-<strong>time attendance devices</strong> were as a Punch. The machine recorded clocking in and out on the card by registering days. Then, someone manually calculated presence days at the end of the monthly or weekly period. However, using fingerprint <strong>time and attendance</strong> devices, traffic logs are instantly registered online and stored on the server. Managers can permit reforms before paying salaries, including vacation, incomplete records, and missions. Plus, a payroll system issues the monthly bill automatically.</li>
<li>Saving time: One method that fingerprint <strong>time and attendance</strong> solutions help employees is to accelerate keeping time because employees do not have to punch cards; Companies do not pay a fee for issuing them. They only need to connect the&nbsp;<strong>time and attendance system</strong> with their fingers.</li>
<li>Elimination of payment disorders; advanced fingerprint systems eliminate time differences by giving access to employers for some settings. Changing the payment rate is one of the facilities that employers access the user interface. For example, a manager may change the payment rate by up to 2 times for people who come on holiday and record the entrance time with their fingerprints or pay employees&#39; attendance with additional hours at an appropriate rate.</li>
<li>Powerful reporting and analysis: Getting a full view through easy reporting of <strong>time and attendance systems</strong> that inform you with decision-making capabilities in real-time.

<li>You never have to worry about losing: Many companies still use cards to register employees clocking in/out time. Even though this idea is good in theory, card attendance systems cause loss of capital and time.</li>
<li>Increase precision: Recorded times require maintenance in manual systems. Manual processes can lead to other issues, including the inabilities to read handwriting or even cheat. Otherwise, by using attendance devices, you can reduce the number of mistakes and neglect.</li>
<li>More Productivity: It is vital to collect time cards to pay salaries in the manual process at the end of the period. Not only it just seems tedious, but it also could take several hours. Furthermore, if the responsibilities are on one individual, it will take a long time.
