<h2><strong>Identification methods in attendance devices:</strong></h2>

<p>Modern timekeeping systems automate calculations to eliminate payroll errors and speed processes. They are integrated with time and attendance software and other time clocks to provide advanced functionality and protection against buddy punching.</p>

<p>One of the goals inherent to a web-based <a href="https://www.palizafzar.com/en/" target="_blank" title="time and attendance system"><strong>time and attendance system</strong></a> is to inhibit buddy punching one employee and clocking another employee in or out to receive undeserved pay. Instead of using paper time cards, which any employee could easily punch for another employee, most networked time clock rollouts require input from the employee unique to that employee, such as a PIN or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics" target="_blank" title="biometrics">biometrics</a>.</p>

<div>
<h2><strong>Questions that you must answer before purchasing a time &amp; attendance system:</strong></h2>

<p>Do you need to track all of your employees or just hourly workers? Do you have an organizational chart of your company that can help our experts to understand your workplace? Do you know the rules of employees&rsquo; entry and exit hours at work? Do you consider any people for the training course and work with the time and attendance systems with enough IT and computer knowledge? How many employees do you need to track?</p>

<p>How many administrators and supervisors will need access to time clocks? How many levels of sign-in and approval do you need for time and attendance systems? Do you have a plan for who will have the authority to authorize overtime and vacation requests? How are your employees clocking in now? Have you handwritten time notebooks? Think about your process and how it could be. This is a great one to get you thinking about how many physical clocks you might need and where you would position them in your facility. Do you have issues with buddy punching? Biometric time clock hardware options are a handy and accessible option for deterring buddy punching.</p>

<h2><strong>Identification methods in time attendance devices:</strong></h2>

<p>Networked time clocks use networked communications to synchronize data between time and attendance software and one or more time clocks. Networked time clocks typically offer clocks, including Pin, Card, Fingerprint Biometric, Facial Biometrics, and Iris Biometrics.</p>

<p>By requiring biometric data such as a fingerprint or facial scan, biometric time clocks help you achieve the best return on investment for any time and attendance system rollout. In addition to scheduling, Advance Systems provides the metrics you need to schedule correctly.</p>

<div>
<h2><strong>Some common reasons a company might research clocking alternatives or rugged time clocks include:</strong></h2>
<ul class="mar-btm-30">
<li>Employees work with acid or other harsh chemicals.</li>
<li>A time clock is exposed to elements or humidity.</li>
<li>Employees wear gloves while working.</li>
<li>Employees work outdoors</li>
<li>Companie seeks a hygienic biometric solution.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Time attendance buying guide conclusion:</strong></h2>

<p>Finding and buying the right time clock for your company really boils down to the following points:</p>

<ul class="mar-btm-30">
<li>Clocking type preference</li>
<li>Communications availability</li>
<li>System integration &amp; architecture</li>
<li>Environmental concerns &amp; system reliability</li>
<li>Supporting features planned in software and time attendance systems</li>
</ul>
