<div id="Attendance-System">
<h3>What is an Attendance System?</h3>
<p>An attendance system automates the process of recording employee presence, replacing manual time-tracking methods. Modern systems often integrate with access control solutions to enhance security.</p>
<h4>Key Features of Modern Attendance Systems</h4>
<ul class="mar-btm-40">
<li>Biometric Technology: Use of unique biological traits like fingerprints or facial patterns.</li>
<li>Integration: Compatibility with payroll and HR systems.</li>
<li>Connectivity: Features like Wi-Fi and cloud-based management for remote access.</li>
<li>Security: Prevents proxy attendance and unauthorized access.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="Fingerprint-Recognition">
<h3>Fingerprint Recognition: How It Works</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.palizafzar.com/en/articles/fingerprint-attendance-device/" target="_blank" title="fingerprint recognition">fingerprint recognition</a> rely on scanning and storing unique patterns of ridges and valleys on an individual’s fingerprint. The stored data is then matched with subsequent scans to verify identity.</p>
<h4>Advantages of Fingerprint Recognition</h4>
<ol class="mar-btm-40">
<li>Accuracy: High precision due to unique fingerprint patterns.</li>
<li>Cost-Effectiveness: Affordable hardware and implementation.</li>
<li>Compact Design: Small devices, ideal for constrained spaces.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Drawbacks</h4>
<ul class="mar-btm-40">
<li>Hygiene Issues: Physical contact can raise cleanliness concerns.</li>
<li>Performance Impact: May fail for employees with worn-out fingerprints (e.g., manual laborers).</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="Face-Recognition">
<h3>Face Recognition: How It Works</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.palizafzar.com/en/articles/facial-recognition-attendance-machin/" target="_blank" title="face recognition">face recognition</a> use advanced cameras and AI algorithms to map facial features. These systems analyze parameters like the distance between eyes, nose shape, and jawline for identity verification.</p>
<h4>Advantages of Face Recognition</h4>
<ul class="mar-btm-40">
<li>Contactless: No physical touch required, making it hygienic.</li>
<li>Dynamic Detection: Works even with minor changes in appearance (e.g., glasses or masks).</li>
<li>High Scalability: Handles large datasets efficiently.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Drawbacks</h4>
<ul class="mar-btm-40">
<li>Environmental Sensitivity: Performance may drop in poor lighting or extreme angles.</li>
<li>Higher Costs: Advanced hardware and software can be expensive.</li>
</ul>
