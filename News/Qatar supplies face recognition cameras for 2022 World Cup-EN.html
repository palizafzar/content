<p>The FIFA World Cup 2022 will be hosted in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar" target="_blank" title="Qatar"><u>Qatar</u></a> and will take place across 8 different stadiums. The event will also be viewed by millions of fans and 15,000 CCTV cameras that are connected to facial recognition technologies.</p>

<p>It is anticipated that one million people would travel to Qatar to watch the international soccer event that will take place from November 20 to December 18, 2022.</p>

<p>According to France24, the network of facial recognition-enabled security cameras sends information into the Aspire command and control center, which monitors for threats such as terrorism and football hooligans. The control center, according to the organizers, raises the bar for international sporting event security.</p>

<p>The network also includes drones for monitoring the amount of crowds in metropolitan streets.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://youtu.be/dLlgzZ_Acko" title="Hayya Card" target="_blank"><u>Hayya Card</u></a> is a digital identification document that will be used to regulate access to events. In order to apply for a Hayya Card, applicants will need to provide a scan of their passport in addition to a high-quality photo of their face.</p>

<h2>Multiple unknown companies providing face recognition services</h2>

<p>The developers who are responsible for the facial recognition technology have not been identified.</p>

<p>As is typical for large-scale deployments, the system incorporates face recognition technology from many suppliers to eliminate false positive and false negative matches, according to an industry source.</p>

<p>After providing its biometric algorithms for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia, NtechLab was reportedly in discussions to provide its facial recognition technology for the tournament in 2019. The business declined to comment on its participation in the security system when asked by Biometric Update.</p>

<p>NEC offered face recognition technology to the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, while Vision-Box contributed video surveillance technology.</p>

<p>The Gulf Times reports that Huawei is the World Cup&#39;s network and IT infrastructure supplier, and that the company is supplying the City Intelligent Twins smart city platform in addition to 5G, augmented reality, virtual reality, and video technology. According to the insider, Huawei is the system integrator responsible for the face recognition feature.</p>
