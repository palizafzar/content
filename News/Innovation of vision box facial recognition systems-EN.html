<h2><strong>Decreasing pathogens at airports by facial recognition systems</strong></h2>

<p>The risk and facilitation of the quick spread of person-to-person or surface-to person transmissible pathogens, due to the continuous growth of global travel, are regularly increasing at airports. Nowadays, the most significant challenge for airports and airlines is representing a solution for reducing disease transmission. Some of the reasons that the aviation industry plays such a decisive role in reducing the transmission of infectious diseases are current global travel models, quite a bit of passenger, and increased capacity demand.</p>

<p>Vision-Box providing self-service biometric-based airport solutions has launched a new manufacturing and logistics facility in Portugal. This company, which provides technology for <a href="https://www.palizafzar.com/en/articles/biometric-technology-features/" target="_blank" title="biometric"><strong>biometric</strong></a> recognition and automation for passenger behavior, border control, and digital identity management, is located in Ab&oacute;boda, Greater Lisbon, as well as factory and warehouse facility is spread over an area of 8,000ft&sup2;.</p>

<p>Vision-Box CEO Miguel Leitmann said: &ldquo;The opening of Ab&oacute;boda factory and warehouse facility serves the company&rsquo;s growth by offering large-scale modern manufacturing, coherent with the increasing global demand for seamless travel solutions and advanced ergonomics hardware, which is one of our distinctive products&rsquo; signature.&rdquo; The company noted that there is a growing demand for airport biometrics and automation; airports and airlines spent nearly $50bn on IT solutions last year.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While every airport has planned for incidents such as mass casualties, natural disasters, and manmade events, very few have put in place systems to mitigate the risk of communicable disease transmission,&rdquo; Vision-Box writes in the white paper&rsquo;s end. &ldquo;Airports can gauge and manage this risk present throughout the passenger journey by deploying Seamless Flow and Identity Management clearance systems.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="mar-btm-30">Vision-Box notes that over 100 million travelers use its technology each year, with significant customers already invested at scale, including Schiphol Airport Amsterdam; Emirates; Aruba, an island in the southern Caribbean Sea; Bangalore Airport; and Los Angeles World Airport. The company recently declared it had gained a contract to present technology for an end-to-end seamless passenger experience at Gatwick airport.</p>
