<p>This spring, facial recognition algorithms reportedly identified 30,000 fraudulent SIM cards in Gujarat, an Indian state on the west coast.</p>
<p>This is in addition to the undetermined number of counterfeit SIM cards that government officials removed from circulation in the Mewat region in February. They were among the half a million SIM cards discovered by anti-fraud officials to have been improperly registered.</p>
<p>In both instances, officials utilized a facial recognition service to conduct so-called SIM subscriber verification. Using the algorithm to examine telco databases revealed hundreds of instances of suspiciously similar features associated with multiple service applications and accounts.</p>
<p>According to the local news publisher Times Now, some retailers purportedly used a single photo to activate hundreds or even thousands of cards with different names. In Gujarat, 37 arrests have been made based on information uncovered during the campaign.</p>
<p>In a critical article, another Indian publication, MediaNama, notes that in order to achieve their objectives, government officials had to unleash algorithms on the entire consumer database of a telco. The publication argues that biometric verification without informed consent violates a subject's right to privacy under the Constitution.</p>
