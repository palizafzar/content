<p><a href="https://www.hotelmanagement.net/tech/marriott-alibaba-trial-facial-recognition-at-china-hotels" target="_blank" title="Hotel Management"><u>Hotel Management</u></a> industry reports that Alibaba would provide facial recognition for biometric check-ins for in-country travelers at two <a href="https://www.marriott.com/default.mi" target="_blank" title="Marriott"><u>Marriott</u></a> International hotels in China.</p>

<p>Alibaba&#39;s travel service platform, Fliggy, is scheduled for July, with a global rollout to follow.</p>

<p>According to Marriott, traditional hotel check-ins take three minutes, even if there is no line. The self-check-in procedure, which consists of an ID document scan, personal information entry, and face recognition verification, is completed in less than one minute.</p>
<h2>A futuristic hotel has been launched by Alibaba in China</h2>

<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangzhou" target="_blank" title="Hangzhou"><u>Hangzhou</u></a>, Alibaba Group has also presented a &quot;future&quot; or "Flyzoo&quot; hotel. As a receptionist, a 1-meter robot with facial recognition capability serves.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.alibaba.com/" target="_blank" title="Alibaba"><u>Alibaba</u></a> has presented a futuristic hotel in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, which it calls the hotel of the future. The 290-room hotel, which has been open to the public since December 2018, is named FlyZoo, a spin on the Chinese phrase "it's a must to stay here." Guests may book in and open their hotel rooms using facial recognition technology; the television, lighting, and room curtains are voice-controlled; and robots serve room service orders placed using Tmall Genie smart speakers. Alibaba believes that the suite of high-tech capabilities will significantly reduce labor costs and the requirement for visitors to communicate with others.</p>

<p>In a similar vein, Tencent has formed a strategic cooperation agreement with Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts, which, according to a separate article published by Hotel Management, will implement artificial intelligence technologies and advanced social network and payment tools for the convenience and personalization of guests.</p>

<p>The corporation manages more than one hundred hotels and resorts worldwide.</p>

<p>This is an opportunity for Tencent to test its smart hotel technology in an operating setting.</p>

<p>According to the Australian edition of Hotel Management, Movenpick plans to roll out 400 smart hotels in China that use facial recognition for check-ins and room access. The launch is made possible via a collaboration with Sunmei Digital Intelligence Group.</p>

<p>The usage of facial recognition at China&#39;s hotels is already popular, with Marriott and Days Inn utilizing it in their lobbies, according to prior reports.</p>

<p>In other regions, biometric technology is increasingly being implemented in hospitality situations.</p>

<p>Incode was selected in May by Emirates-based Jumeirah Group to deliver automated services with biometrics, for example, and has been forming partnerships with hospitality technology suppliers.</p>
