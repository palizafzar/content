    <p>It is known that the main domestic semiconductor electronic information media core master initiated and sponsored
        the "Hardcore China Core" selection. Its mission is to identify and recognize exceptional and innovative Chinese
        core firms through a comprehensive showcase of company products, technology, and solutions. The solutions and
        application scenarios provide a strong foundation for the growth of China's prominent terminal firms. Three
        sessions of the event have been held successfully so far. Around 300 integrated circuit design businesses have
        declared and are well recognized in China's integrated circuit industry.</p>
