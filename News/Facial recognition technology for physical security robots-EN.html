<p>Prosegur Security introduced a robot dog equipped with <a href="https://www.palizafzar.com/en/articles/facial-recognition-attendance-machin/" title="facial recognition" target="_blank"><u>facial recognition</u></a>, and Knightscope introduced automatic criminal detection capabilities (ACDC) to two of its security products. Both of these companies operate in the biometric security industry and have recently introduced new tools.</p>
<h2>The robot dog from Prosegur Security offers video analytics.</h2>
<p>Prosegur Protection, a provider of physical and digital security, has introduced Yellow, a biometric robot dog, to its private and professional security products for perimeter patrol.</p>
<p>Yellow, which is based on Prosegur's GenzAI platform, supposedly has face recognition capabilities and can distinguish "friend from foe" and notify security of possible threats through 5G connectivity.</p>
<p>It is able to detect variations in temperature as well as changes in gas thanks to its sensors, which may signal if there is a fire or a gas leak.</p>
<p>According to Mike Dunn, the Chief Technology Officer of Prosegur, "By leveraging our GenzAI platform, state-of-the-art machine learning, communication, smart cameras, and video analytics, Yellow can detect security threats, relay information to the SOC and on-site security, and quickly respond and neutralize any danger."</p>
<p>In addition, Yellow incorporates technology from Prosegur partner Azena, a German software firm backed by the Bosch Group that specializes in artificial intelligence (AI)-based video analytics.</p>
<p>"Innovation is at the core of everything we do at Azena, and now AI-enabled video analytics can be used to enhance safety, security, and operational efficiency in more industries than ever before," says Azena CEO Hartmut Schaper.</p>
<p>"We are pleased to be collaborating with Prosegur Security to enhance human reaction via the use of advanced detecting technologies."</p>
<p>The robot dog created by Prosegur, which debuted at Rock in Rio Lisbon 2022 and the Mutua Madrid Open, will be formally revealed in the United States the following week at the Global Security Exchange (GSX) event in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
<p>The announcement follows Prosegur's introduction of a new AI policy and the hiring of a chief ethical officer.</p>
<h2>Knightscope adds criminal identification capability to a security robot</h2>
<p>The technology apparently employs face recognition technology and a lawful open-source database with more than 75 million criminal law enforcement files to warn customers to a previously convicted criminal or potential threats on their property.</p>
<p>IPVM has published a report (subscription needed and recommended) about the picture database compiled by Knightscope. Captis Intelligence is the database provider, and the trade journal raises privacy issues and compares the database makeup of other face recognition suppliers.</p>
<p>Knightscope stated that the new ACDC feature will help public safety officials better prepare for potential threats by delivering real-time, hyper-local data for enhanced situational awareness.</p>
<p>Knightscope's chief executive officer, William Santana Li, said, "We are always assessing ways to dissuade, identify, and report suspected illegal activities."</p>
<p>Imagine if we could aid a port in detecting a known terrorist or notify school officials of a sexual predator on your child's campus. This would be a game-changer in securing the areas where we live, work, study, and visit.</p>
<p>In addition, clients will be able to collect data for incident investigations via the user interface of the Knightscope Security Operations Center (KSOC) or by speaking with Knightscope+ monitoring specialists.</p>
<p>"We must equip our nation's more than 2 million law enforcement and security workers with the tools they need to keep our communities safe," Li continues.</p>
<p>Knightscope has also reported substantial investment gains and a new Fortune 500 client within the past few months.</p>
